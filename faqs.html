        <h3>When can I start my activities?</h3>
        <p>
          From the start of Yr 9 for Bronze; Yr 10 for Silver and then Gold from
          your 16th Birthday
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="secondary">
        <h3>Can I do more than one section at a
          time?</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Yes</b>, you can work on sections one at a time or concurrently, or
          stagger your starts to fit into busy schedules.
          <br><br>
          Bronze participants who are not 14 yet may wish to wait utill their
          14th birthday before starting their Volunteering as lots of places may
          not accept you until you are 14.
          <br><br>
          Participants must have their Volunteering, Physical and Skill sections
          signed off before going on the qualifying expedition in May or June.
          (Bronze or Silver)

      <div class="accent">
        <h3>How do I record my activities?</h3>
        <p>
          Keep a record of the dates you attend either on paper or online e.g.
          word document or excel spreadsheet
          <br>
          Make a note of what you have done at the session just in case
          <br>
          All these can be added as notes or evidence on eDofE
          <br>
          Upload pictures of the activities as supporting evidence. (especially
          if you are cooking, using an app to record runs/ bike ride etc)
          <br>

          Do not get your assessor to add a note in your account this will not
          be accepted as an assessors report (see below)

          Watch this video to help you

          How do I log onto eDofE?

          Watch this video

          When will I get my eDofE account and Welcome pack?

          Check your school email address for a welcome email and after 3 weeks
          of logging in to eDofE for the first time, a Welcome pack should then
          arrive at your home address in the post! (assuming you put in the
          correct postcode!)

          I'm having trouble logging in for the first time?

          Once your parents have made the payment on ParentPay an account will
          be set up for you using your school email address. Check for a welcome
          email in here with your username and password. If you cant access your
          school email please visit the IT team (upstairs in MFL block) to get
          you set up.

          Who can I use for my assessor?

          Anyone over 18, who is not related to you AND has an area of interest
          or expertise

          e.g. Physical section -PE teacher, Volunteering - the person you are
          helping but not a relative

          Teachers and Form tutors are always happy to help be assessors -
          Please ask them BEFORE you start

          If in doubt check with a DofE Leader

          What can I do for the Volunteering, Physical or Skills section?

          Go to the DofE website for ideas

          Or have a look at the following:

          Volunteering

          Physical

          Skill

          I don't know my assessor's email or phone number?

          This is a non-compulsory field so submit sections for approval with
          those fields empty

          How do I get my assessor to submit an assessors report?

          Ask them to go to the Assessor Portal

          Give them your eDofE ID number - this can be found on the top left
          hand side when you log into eDofE

          Share with them the following "How to " guidance document and
          "what a report should consist of" document.

          How many in an expedition group?

          Group sizes of 7.

          The aim is for students to get themselves into either a group of 3 or
          a group of 4.

          We will then put a group 3 and a group of 4 together to make up a
          group of 7.

          (Sometimes groups of 5 and 6 will be made but when we have large
          numbers at Bronze and Silver we try to minimise the number of groups.)

          When is my expedition?

          Check out the dates on the expedition page or calendar

          Why hasn’t my activity been approved?

          Leaders are all volunteers it may take them some time to log on and
          check give it a couple of weeks - in the meantime check the
          notifications on eDofE – if a section or piece of evidence has been
          queried you will have a message from the person who queried it with a
          reason.

          The usual reasons are:

          Time commitment not 1 hour per week for 13 weeks (3 months)

          Time commitment not 1 hour per week for 26 weeks (6 months)

          Time commitment not 1 hour per week for 52 weeks (12 months)

          Time commitment not 1 hour per week for 78 weeks (18 months)

          Assessor is related to you

          The activity chosen doesn't meet the requirements for tat section e.g.
          a sport in the skill section or working for a company in the
          volunteering section

          The assessor hasn’t written about what you achieved

          The name of the assessor doesn’t match the name on your plan – in this
          case please revert to draft amend the plan and resubmit

          The assessor report has been uploaded incorrectly

          The assessors reports must be written on the record book sent home,
          photographed with ALL details completed OR

          The assessor goes to www.edofe.org/assessor and uses your eDofE ID to
          register your report

          What equipment do I need for expedition?

          Kit list can be found here

          How do I set up and link an OS maps account to eDofE.

          Please read through the set up guide here.

          Watch the video of how to plan a route here.

          Full list of DofE Video's can be found here.

          DofE website

          How do I know which sections have been approved?

          certificates you have and whether you have completed your hole award.
